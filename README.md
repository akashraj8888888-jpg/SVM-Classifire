Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes.
SVM uses support vectors, which are the data points closest to the decision boundary.
Kernel functions allow SVM to handle non-linear classification problems effectively.
SVM is known for high accuracy, especially in high-dimensional datasets.
